# Water_Pump_Prediction_Driven_Data
Notebook containing CRISP-DM process (i.e EDA, Data Prep, Modeling, Evaluation) for the "Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table" challenge on Driven Data. 
 
The primary objective of this project is to correctly classify the functional status of waterpumps in Tanzania using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. As written on the Driven Data website, "a smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania".
