# Water Pump Prediction Challenge
Using the CRISP-DM process (i.e., EDA, Data Prep, Modeling, Evaluation) for the "Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table" challenge on Driven Data. 

## Project Overview 
The primary objective of this project is to correctly classify the functional status of water pumps in Tanzania using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. As written on the Driven Data website, "a smart understanding of which water points will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania."

**Current Rank:** 2,316/12,810 (Top ~18%) | Classification Rate: 0.8112
